## Inspiration

From politicians and comedians, to interviewees and people with social anxiety, SpeakAR could help all kinds of public speakers perfect facial expressions and make the best first impression!

## What It Does

An augmented reality feature with Spark AR that allows users to practice facial expressions for public speaking by tracking the user’s face and giving the user feedback on how well they match a given expression. We utilized animations and transitions to enhance the user’s journey and gamify the experience by incrementing points for every proper expression and timing the user with a one-minute clock.
